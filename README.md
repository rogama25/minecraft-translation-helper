# rogama's Minecraft translation helper

This project aims to be a simple program that can help you when you need to translate Minecraft language files, doing it in a guided way instead of editing directly the .lang files.

## Downloads

You can download my program [here](https://github.com/rogama25/minecraft-translation-helper/releases/latest). You can get the precompiled version for windows or run it directly from the source code.

#### Requirements
* To run from source code you need to have Python 3.6.8 installed (other versions may or may not work). [For Windows or MacOS, get it here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) For Linux, follow the instruction for your distribution.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Finally, just run `python main.py`
